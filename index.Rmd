### Abstract

*Backrounds:*
In this analysis we are going to explore relationships between usage of alcohol, family relationships and grades of Italian secondary level students. I
  
*Methods:*
I am using multiple and simple linear regression.

### Research question

The dataset that I am using in the final assignment concerns alcohol consumption among Italian secondary level students. I am especially interested in the relations between family relationships and alcohol consumption. We will also see what kind of effect these have in the grades.

My hypothesis is that bad family relationships implicate higher alcohol consumption rate and lower grades. I will also examine the parents' education's effect on the child. I have added a few variables to the data concerning this case to help the analysis.

Here is a link to the data wrangling file:

### Summarizing and visualization

Let us begin our analysis by reading the dataset from the wrangling file.

Reading the datasets:
```{r message = F, warning = F} 
setwd("~/Desktop/IODS-final-master")
alc <- read.csv("alc.csv")
alc <- alc[,2:38]
library(ggplot2)
library(GGally)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(corrplot)
```

Exploring the structure and the dimensions of the data

```{r}
str(alc)
dim(alc)
```

This data consists of 38 variables and 382 observations. Let's take a look a summary of the data:

What the variables are representing, can be seen from the following:

1. school - student's school (binary: 'GP' - Gabriel Pereira or 'MS' - Mousinho da Silveira) 
2. sex - student's sex (binary: 'F' - female or 'M' - male) 
3. age - student's age (numeric: from 15 to 22) 
4. address - student's home address type (binary: 'U' - urban or 'R' - rural) 
5. famsize - family size (binary: 'LE3' - less or equal to 3 or 'GT3' - greater than 3) 
6. Pstatus - parent's cohabitation status (binary: 'T' - living together or 'A' - apart) 
7. Medu - mother's education (numeric: 0 - none, 1 - primary education (4th grade), 2 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5th to 9th grade, 3 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ secondary education or 4 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ higher education) 
8. Fedu - father's education (numeric: 0 - none, 1 - primary education (4th grade), 2 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5th to 9th grade, 3 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ secondary education or 4 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ higher education) 
9. Mjob - mother's job (nominal: 'teacher', 'health' care related, civil 'services' (e.g. administrative or police), 'at_home' or 'other') 
10. Fjob - father's job (nominal: 'teacher', 'health' care related, civil 'services' (e.g. administrative or police), 'at_home' or 'other') 
11. reason - reason to choose this school (nominal: close to 'home', school 'reputation', 'course' preference or 'other') 
12. guardian - student's guardian (nominal: 'mother', 'father' or 'other') 
13. traveltime - home to school travel time (numeric: 1 - <15 min., 2 - 15 to 30 min., 3 - 30 min. to 1 hour, or 4 - >1 hour) 
14. studytime - weekly study time (numeric: 1 - <2 hours, 2 - 2 to 5 hours, 3 - 5 to 10 hours, or 4 - >10 hours) 
15. failures - number of past class failures (numeric: n if 1<=n<3, else 4) 
16. schoolsup - extra educational support (binary: yes or no) 
17. famsup - family educational support (binary: yes or no) 
18. paid - extra paid classes within the course subject (Math or Portuguese) (binary: yes or no) 
19. activities - extra-curricular activities (binary: yes or no) 
20. nursery - attended nursery school (binary: yes or no) 
21. higher - wants to take higher education (binary: yes or no) 
22. internet - Internet access at home (binary: yes or no) 
23. romantic - with a romantic relationship (binary: yes or no) 
24. famrel - quality of family relationships (numeric: from 1 - very bad to 5 - excellent) 
25. freetime - free time after school (numeric: from 1 - very low to 5 - very high) 
26. goout - going out with friends (numeric: from 1 - very low to 5 - very high) 
27. Dalc - workday alcohol consumption (numeric: from 1 - very low to 5 - very high) 
28. Walc - weekend alcohol consumption (numeric: from 1 - very low to 5 - very high) 
29. health - current health status (numeric: from 1 - very bad to 5 - very good) 
30. absences - number of school absences (numeric: from 0 to 93) 
31. G1 - first period grade (numeric: from 0 to 20) 
32. G2 - second period grade (numeric: from 0 to 20) 
33. G3 - final grade (numeric: from 0 to 20, output target) 
34. alc_use - mean of alcohol use (from work days and weekends) (numeric)
35. high_use - high usage of alcohol (logical: T or F)
36. bothAtHome - both of the parents' job is "at home" (logical: T or F)
37. parentEdu - both of the parents have at least a secondary level education (logical: T or F)

So, before the analysis we have combined two datasets and added a few new variables to the data. Before we go to deeper analysis, we shall take a visual look at the distributions of the interesting variables and correlations between them.


```{r}
interesting <- c("age", "failures", "famrel", "health", "alc_use", "parentEdu", "G3")
ggpairs((select(alc, one_of(interesting)))) + ggtitle("Distributions and correlations")
corrplot(cor(select(alc,one_of(interesting))), method="square", type="upper", cl.pos="b", tl.pos="d", tl.cex=0.6)
```
  
    
We can see that there is a strong negative correlation between the grade means and the failures, which is quite logical. What is more interesting is that there is a correlation between parents' education and the failures. The grade means seem to be almost normally distributed and the alcohol usage seems to be somewhat exponentially distributed.

### Analysis


**Linear regression**  
This statistical test is testing how well the target value ($y$) corresponds to the explanatory variables ($x_1, x_2, x_3, ...$), if we assume that there is a linear regression between the variables, so that $y = \alpha + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + \beta_3x_3 + ... + \epsilon$, where $\epsilon$ is assumed to be a normally distributed error variable with a mean of 0. 
  

##### **Grades as target**

```{r}
summary(lm(alc$G3 ~ alc$famrel + alc$alc_use))
```

Here we have a summary of the linear regression model, where $y$ = G3 $x_1$ = famrel and $x_2$ = alc_use. Our results are as follows: $\beta_1$ = 0.1506 and $\beta_2$ = -0.5083. We have two null hyphothesis - one that family relationships don't explain the grades and one that nor does the usage of alcohol ($\beta_{1,2} = 0$). For the first hypothesis we get a p-value of 0.42, which doesn't lead to rejection of the null hypothesis. On the other hand, for the later hypothesis we get a p-value of 0.003, which tells that with a significance level of 0.05 we can reject the null hypothesis quite confidently. Let's draw a plot to see this result:

```{r}
plot(G3 ~ jitter(alc_use,3), data = alc)
abline(lm(G3 ~ alc_use, data = alc), col = "red")
```


##### **Usage of alcohol as target**

Next let's have a look at the hypothesis that family relationships explain the usage of alcohol.

```{r}
summary(lm(alc_use ~ famrel,data = alc))
plot(jitter(alc$alc_use,3) ~ jitter(alc$famrel,4))
abline(lm(alc_use ~ famrel, data = alc), col = "red")
```
  
    
    
Looks like we can reject this null hypothesis and conclude that better family relationships tend to decrease the usage of alcohol.


### Conclusions and discussion
  
  
Our results are as following:

* family relationships doesn't have effect on grades
* greater usage of alcohol leads to worse grades
* better family relationships imply smaller usage of alcohol
